## Features

- **Simple**: Quick to setup and integrate
- **Standard**: Just HTTPS + JSON
- **Managed**: Hosted via serverless functions
- **Scalable**: Scales to any capacity
- **Usage based**: Pay only for what you use
- **Focused**: We only do one thing and do it well
- **Immutable deployments**: All API updates are optional

## Introduction

Puppet Master provides hosted, serverless SaaS APIs for controlling headless chrome in the cloud.

Our goal is to make it really simple for developers to scale automated browser workflows via [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev).

## Functions

### Screenshot

Navigates to a page and captures a screenshot via Puppeteer's [Page.screenshot](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=v1.19.0&show=api-pagescreenshotoptions).

All Puppeteer options are supported.

Returns an image as either `image/png` or `image/jpeg` depending on the `type` parameter.

### Pdf

Navigates to a page and captures a PDF via Puppeteer's [Page.pdf](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=v1.19.0&show=api-pagepdfoptions).

All Puppeteer options are supported.

Returns a PDF as `application/pdf`.

### Common Options

In addition to the standard parameters, all functions optionally accept a set of additional common options.

- [viewport](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=v1.19.0&show=api-pagesetviewportviewport) - Set the browser window's viewport dimensions and/or resolution.
- [userAgent](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=v1.19.0&show=api-pagesetuseragentuseragent) - Set the browser's [user-agent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent).
  - Useful to trick websites into displaying different content or styles based on an emulated device.
- [gotoOptions](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=v1.19.0&show=api-pagegotourl-options) - Customize the `Page.goto` navigation options.
  - Useful when you need to customize behavior around when Puppeteer considers a page navigation "finished".
- [emulateDevice](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=v1.19.0&show=api-pageemulateoptions) - Make it look like the screenshot was taken on the specified device.
  - Use the `name` property from one of the built-in [devices](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/lib/DeviceDescriptors.js).
  - Overrides `viewport` and `userAgent`.

## FAQ

### Why are my screenshots blurry?

Try setting [viewport.deviceScaleFactor](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=v1.19.0&show=api-pagesetviewportviewport) to `2` to emulate a retina display.

### How is this project different from other alternatives?

The differences can be broken down into two areas:

**Functionality**

- We use serverless functions to provide maximum scalability while minimizing cost.
- This also means that you only pay for what you actually use.
- You could set this up yourself, but headless chrome is a resource hog and who wants to setup and manage another async task queue?
- We also allow you to run functions locally which is essential for debugging.

**Philisophy**

The core motivation behind this project lies in trying to tackle the problem of open source sustainability.

Towards that end, every aspect of this SaaS product aside from the core functionality was generated automatically via [Saasify](https://saasify.sh), the Shopify for SaaS. That includes the template-based marketing website, OpenAPI-based API docs, serverless function hosting, user account management, usage-based billing integration, legal docs, and support.

It's our hope that by greatly simplifying and automating the process of launching SaaS APIs, open source authors will be much more inclined to monetize their work and help to sustain their passion while still holding true to the underlying nature of OSS.

Puppet Master is therefore a SaaS product that is fully generated from the source code in this repository. If you know how to create an open source TypeScript project like this one, you're already 95% of your way towards creating your own monetizable SaaS product!

### The functionality I need is missing.

We're actively looking for feedback and feature suggestions.

Please [contact us](mailto:support@saasify.sh) or open an issue on this repo.

Thanks!

### How do subscriptions work?

All APIs come with a free public tier that is rate-limited so you can test things out before signing up for a subscription.

Saasify uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to securely handle all payments, subscriptions, and invoices.

We use usage-based, metered subscriptions that charge fractions of a cent depending on three factors:

- Number of authenticated API calls
- Aggregate compute time
- Bandwidth in / out

Signing up for a subscription starts a weekly billing cycle. Note that you will only be charged for what you use.

See [pricing](/pricing) for more details.

### This project is great! How can I help out?

Collaboration is what makes open source truly powerful! If you're interested in working on Puppet Master or have an idea for your own Saasify product, please [contact us](mailto:info@saasify.sh) to learn more. Thanks!

### How can I debug potential issues with the API?

If your API calls are not working or returning unexpected results, the best way to troubleshoot is to try and reproduce your issue by running the project locally.

- Clone this repository
- Install `saasify` globally via `npm install -g saasify`
- Run `saasify dev` at the repo root specifying an additional environment variable `PUPPET_MASTER_DEBUG`

```
PUPPET_MASTER_DEBUG=1 saasify dev
```

This will run the deployment locally with a non-headless browser and `slowMo` set to `1000`.

Then just change the URL you're calling to be the corresponding `localhost` URL and investigate the issue.
